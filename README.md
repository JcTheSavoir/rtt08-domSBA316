Project Name: SBA 316 The Document Object Model
Creator: J.C.
Date Started: 3/22/2024

Project Info: This project is used to test a learners grasp on the Document Object Model, along with their ability to implement fundamental concepts of the DOM.  There are a few main objectives the user will need to show with this. 

//-----------------------------------Main Objectives----------------------//
   -Use DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a web application that provides a
dynamic user experience.
   -Use BOM properties, methods, and techniques to facilitate creation of a dynamic web
application.
   -Demonstrate profciency with event-driven programming and DOM events.
   -Implement basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes
and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.

//-----------------------------Absolute minimum Requirements-----------------//
Finish these first, and only add additional features if you have time left.

Requirements and their graded Weight:
    -Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent. {10%}
    -Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).  {10%}
    -Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task. {10%}
    -Register at least two diferent event listeners and create the associated event handler functions. {10%}
    -Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the style or classList properties. {5%}
    -Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (frstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.).  {5%}
    -Commit frequently to the git repository. {5%}
    -Create at least one element using createElement. {5%}
    -Cache at least one element using selectElementById. {5%}
    -Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM. {5%}
    -Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll. {5%}
    -Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation. {5%}
    -Level of efort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience. {5%}
    -Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation. (This canbe the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation.)5%
    -Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods. {3%}
    -Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction. {3%}
    -Include a README fle that contains a description of your application. {2%}
    -Use the DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the cloneNode method to create templated content. {2%}
